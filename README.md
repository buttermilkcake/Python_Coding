# Python_Coding

These are my Python coding examples from the book, "Python Crash Course" By Eric Matthes, which I started using in January of 2016. This book is divided into two parts; the first part covers Python programming basics and the second part covers 3 projects. These are examples from the first part of the book which breaks down like this:

Ch. 1 -  Basics

Ch. 2 -  Variables and Simple Data Types

Ch. 3 -  Introducing Lists

Ch. 4 -  Working with Lists

Ch. 5 -  if Statements

Ch. 6 -  Dictionaries

Ch. 7 -  User Input and while Loops

Ch. 8 -  Functions

Ch. 9 -  Classes

Ch. 10 - Files and Exceptions

Ch. 11 - Testing Your Code
